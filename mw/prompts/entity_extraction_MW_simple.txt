-Goal-
Given a YAML file that is relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [QUOTE_ID,APPLICATION_NAME,CELL,FILTER,CHEMICAL,OPTICS]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
- Instructions for QUOTE_ID and APPLICATION_NAME: For the description of these entities, use the Quote_ID, Application_Name and Application_Summary.
- Instructions for type CHEMICAL: For these chemical stream entities, the entity name should follow this pattern: <Name> - <Type> - <Measurement specification1> - <Measurement specification2>, etc
  Here are how the different chemical characteristics should be translated to form part of the entity names:
    Type: Measurement -> MEAS
	  Type: Matrix -> MATRIX
	  Type: Matrix or Interferer -> MATRIX_OR_INT
    Nominal_Concentration -> NOM
    Max_Concentration -> MAX
    Quoted_Max_Measurement_Concentration -> QUOTE MAX
    Desired_Measurement_Repeatability -> REPEAT
  Examples:
    WATER - MEAS - 0.0006 NOM - 0.01 MAX - 0.01 QUOTE MAX - 1.0 REPEAT
    DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE - MATRIX_OR_INT - 10 NOM - 100 MAX
	1,2-DICHLOROETHANE - MATRIX - 99.9 NOM - 100.0 MAX
- Instructions for CELL: form the name using this pattern:  CELL - <Heating_Mode> - <Temperature> ºC - <Lenght> - <Material> - <Window> - <Pressure> P
  Examples:
  CELL - ELECTRIC - 50 ºC - 2.0 MM - HAST C - SAPPHIRE - ATM P
- Instructions for FILTER: always use the prefix FILT, then a dash, then wavelength, a dash, the Chem, a dash and finally the role. If some property is missing, ignore it and removed its associated dash.
  Examples:
  FILT - 3.71 - H2O - REF
  FILT - 3.71 - REF
- Instructions for OPTICS: always use this pattern: SRC <Source> - DET <Detector> - LENS <Lens>
  Examples:
  SRC UV - DET UV W/SF - LENS CAF2
  SRC IR - DET BAF2 - LENS CAF2
1.1 MANDATORY: Format each entity as ("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are related to each other (deduct the relationship from the YAML file structure).
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity. Here are some explicit strenghts to use:
  - CELL <-> QUOTE_ID : 5
  - FILTER <-> QUOTE_ID : 8
  - CHEMICAL <-> QUOTE_ID : 10 if Meas or Matrix, 7 otherwise
  - APPLICATION_NAME <-> QUOTE_ID: 10
- Use the YAML hierarchy to create the relationships. The top level is the Quote_ID. If there are no entities for a certain level, skip it (like Hardware_Config, Stream and Filter_Wheel should be skipped). For example:
  - Create a relationship between each FILTER and the QUOTE_ID (skipping Filter_Wheel and Hardware_Config)
  - Create a relationship between CELL and the QUOTE_ID.
  - Create a relationship between a CHEMICAL and the QUOTE_ID. If type MEAS, make the strength 10. If the CHEMICAL has a relationship with a FILTER, also make this relationship 10. Otherwise make it less strength.
  - Attempt to create relationships between CHEMICAL and FILTER. For example, FILT - 2.55 - CH3I - MEAS would have a relationship with the CHEMICAL - METHYL IODIDE. The chemical names will not necessarily match but use your knowledge of chemistry to make the proper associations. Rate the strenght according to your confidence in the chemical match. Sometimes the role of the filter and the chemical type will not match but the chemical name will match. In these cases, still add a relationship but lower the strength.
2.1 MANDATORY: Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use ## as the list delimiter. NO EXPLANATION. NO TRAILING SPACES. FOLLOW THE FORMAT EXPLAINED IN 1.1 and 2.1.

4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.
